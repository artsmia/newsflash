**Are night-owls smarter?**

****

Benjamin Franklin, or whoever actually said “early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise,” was apparently a moron. New research suggests that the higher your IQ, the more likely you are to stay up late and sleep late in the morning; the lower your IQ, the more likely you are to follow standard sleep operating procedure.

Night owls, notably a lot of artists, may indeed be more open-minded and anti-establishment, flouting standard sleep patterns. They may also follow their muse a little closer, staying up to finish projects that everyone else shelves until the next day. But hey, good luck getting that worm.
