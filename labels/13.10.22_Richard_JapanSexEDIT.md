Japan’s plummeting reproduction rates are well documented. Its population of 126 million is projected to plunge by more than one-third by 2060, generating vastly more retirees than toddlers.

Yet, the problem seems to stem from a complex source: intolerance of intimacy. According to the Japan Family Planning Association, 45% of women aged 16–24 “were not interested in or despised sexual contact”; a quarter of corresponding males shared the sentiment. The Japanese media has a new name for it: *sekkusu shinai shokogun*—or “celibacy syndrome.”
