**Is Narcissus alive and well?**

****

In Greek mythology, Narcissus fell in love with his own reflection in a pool of water. But in modern America he’d hardly be alone in his self-regard. New studies by Jean M. Twenge, a sociology professor at San Diego State, suggest that today’s young adults, known as millennials, are “increasingly entitled, self-obsessed, and unprepared for the realities of adult life” (her words, not ours)—a 30 percent increase in narcissistic traits compared to previous generations. 

How did this happen? Twenge blames a cultural shift in thinking that self-esteem is necessary for success rather than the result of it. And despite the many critics of her findings, the popularity of Botox, social networking, and trophies for every kid in sports indicate that
 “Generation Me” might be more than just the catchy name of her book.
