**Food pic = ick?**

****

Pictures of food, more popular than snaps of kids or even dogs or cats, consume social media sites like Instagram and Facebook. But how appetizing are they?

Not much, says a recent study by researchers at University of Minnesota and Brigham Young University, published in the *Journal of Consumer Psychology*. Indeed, the mere act of photographing your meal actually diminishes excitement for consuming it. So why whip out the smart phone? Just conjecture, but might it be a hi-tech dieting technique? Or a way to stoke food envy with one’s network? *—Diane Richard, writer, November 21*
