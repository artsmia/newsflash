**Eggcellent Eaglets?**

****

The stork visited the Twin Cities EagleCam nest this week, bringing two eaglets into the digital world. 

The Minnesota DNR’s live-video link has had its eagle eye directed on the mom-and-pop bald eagles, giving viewers worldwide a glimpse. The hatching brings soaring excitement and relief, as the birds and their eggs weathered the recent harsh cold to emerge downy. See it yourself: webcams.dnr.state.mn.us/eagle/
