**Here’s Lucy?**

****

Residents of Celoron, N.Y., would appreciate this rear view of their hometown hero, Lucille Ball. 

Especially compared to Celoron’s statue loved by none—nicknamed Scary Lucy (above). A social media sensation, Scary Lucy drew visitors—but for all the wrong reasons. Unveiled in 2009, the bronze lacked all that made Ball famous: joy, wit, beauty, humor. A substitute statue recently arrived on the scene (right). Today, Celoron’s mayor says: “You can stand at any angle and look and say, ‘That’s Lucy.’”       —*Diane Richard, writer, August 11, 2016*
