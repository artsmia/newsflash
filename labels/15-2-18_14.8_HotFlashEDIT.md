**Is it hot, or is it just me?**

****

Hot flashes are nature’s way of telling half the population that it’s time for a new phase of life.

Turns out, nature takes her sweet time getting the world out to some women. Results from the largest, most diverse study of middle-aged women reveal that some face 7–14 years of hot flashes and night sweats as their hormones drop into lower gear. Over all, black and Hispanic women experienced hot flashes for significantly longer periods than white or Asian women. And in a cruel twist, those who suffer hot flashes earlier in life tend to have them longer as well—extending the lifespan of many desk fans.       —*Diane Richard, writer, February 18*
