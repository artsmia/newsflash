**Artists Out on a Limb?**

****

With thousands of trees, limbs, and branches suddenly littering our cities, we may feel some of the same Romantic tug at the heartstrings experienced by the artists who sought the overwhelming majesty of the Forest of Fontainebleau. In the decades after Michallon painted this study, the forest became a veritable outdoor studio for hundreds of artists eager to trade the refinement of Paris for and poetry of nature.
