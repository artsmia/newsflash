**Does faith make us leap?**

****

Believers talk of putting their fate in the hands of God. But how about their purchasing decisions? Yep, that too: Advertising that alludes to God, or just the concept of the divine, seems to encourage consumers to take risks.

The idea of God, researchers recently concluded, makes people feel safe and protected, whether you’re heading into surgery or just buying a new washer-dryer. Even when the idea was presented offhandedly, like, “God only knows what you’re missing!” in an ad for sky-diving classes, people were more likely to sign on. The only solicitations for which divine intervention didn’t help: immoral activities.
