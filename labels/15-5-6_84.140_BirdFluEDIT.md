**I’ll fly away?**

Chickens and turkeys may not be as lovely as the birds in this painting, but they are important to Minnesota’s economy, and they’re dying in alarming numbers due to the recent bird-flu outbreak. 

More than 1 million birds have died because of the flu or been killed to prevent its spread. Minnesota is the nation’s largest producer of turkeys, and one turkey-processing plant has already laid off workers due to a lack of poultry product. Unlike other types of avian flu that have hit parts of Asia, the current strain is not known to spread to humans. Still, farmers and scientists—and animal lovers—are concerned because its rapid spread among birds in the region is still not understood.
