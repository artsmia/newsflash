**Women at work**

****

 Kiki Smith’s works defy traditional object making, with many pieces paralleling the traditional representation of women in art history. Smith focuses on gender roles being assigned based upon society and culture, not biology. This commentary exposes the flaws of many of the gender norms we have come to accept. 

Smith uses a wide variety of materials and styles to explore themes of the body and sexuality. By challenging the viewer to dive into societal issues through the representation of the body, Smith begins a commentary on what different forms of the body can represent. What do Smith’s fetal pose and worm-like position in *Worm* represent to you? *
