**Obsessive love?**

****

We’ve heard it in song lyrics. We’ve seen it in movies. After the breakup, you can’t move on. You think about them constantly.

Scientists have named this condition *limerance*. While most people do recover from heartbreak, some people develop a kind of psychological illness. One reason is that reminders of your ex are ever-present thanks to social media. You open up Facebook and there they are—with someone else? The feelings come pouring back, and your mind lands in a state of limerance. And it can happen to anyone. Listen to most country songs and you’ll agree.
