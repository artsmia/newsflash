**Swap and share?**

****

You’ve probably seen professional athletes after the game, chatting it up, then taking off and trading their jerseys. Why? Seems some players want souvenirs of their games.

This is nothing new, but thanks to social media sites like Instagram, we’re seeing this kind of exchange more often. Turns out, the trend may have started way before the NFL. Quilters have often swapped blocks of cloth to create one-of-a-kind quilts made by their friends. Check out the Baltimore Quilt, hanging above, representing the talents of 36 women. What a lasting way to share your work.
