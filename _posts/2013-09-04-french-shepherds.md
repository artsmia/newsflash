**Who’s endangering whom?**

****

The reestablishment of a viable wolf population to the Alps has results only too expected by French shepherds.

Once driven to extinction by hunters and loss of territory, wolves have returned to prowl the French countryside. Trouble is, there’s far less of it than in expansive North America. And French shepherds—who report the slaughter of some 20,000 sheep by wolves over the past five years—contend their livelihoods and their flocks are next on the endangered list.
