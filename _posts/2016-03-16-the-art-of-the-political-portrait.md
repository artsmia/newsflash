**The art of the political portrait?**

****

Let’s talk about the time-honored history of portraits and their ability to project clues about the status of their sitters. Really, that’s all we’re going to talk about here. No. *Really*. 

 For instance, take this Burgomaster, whose lavish choice of lace and gilded embroidery sent Holland’s strait-laced  Calvinists swooning. The “town mayor” is portrayed as a gentleman of leisure, standing on the veranda of his estate. Like Donald J. Trump’s portait hanging at his Mar-a-Lago estate in his tennis whites. Both men appear self-assured and proud. Both directly confront the viewer. And both likely loved the reflection they saw. See? Not tough at all.*                              —Diane Richard, writer, March 16*
