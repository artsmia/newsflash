**Seeing eye to eye?**

****

Would you buy cereal from this woman? Theoretically, a vast number of us would. Seems we respond powerfully to packaging designed to look us straight in the eye.

Recent studies show the impact of a direct gaze, even from cereal boxes featuring goofy characters. When presented with two versions of the cartoonish Trix—one looking down, another looking directly out at shoppers—those who had gazed into the rabbit’s eyes reported higher feelings of trust and connection. They were also more likely to choose that cereal over other brands.
