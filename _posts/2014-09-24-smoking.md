**Eat, Drink & Be Eighty?**

Singer/songwriter Leonard Cohen, pictured here, is ready to re-embrace the pleasures of youth: smoking.

At his 80th birthday, he declared it was time to start smoking again. His announcement inflamed a modern debate: At what age do you embrace your mortality and the pleasures that might speed you to its end?

Groups like the American Cancer Society are now sighing a collective groan. Illness caused by smoking and secondhand smoke—cancer and asthma, to name two—continues to plague America’s health system. Despite it, our over-80 population is only growing.
