**Bird lovers crying fowl?**

****

Turns out, sadly, wind turbines and birds don’t mix.

Minnesota conservationists and wind energy proponents faced off recently over bird deaths caused by wind-turbine blades. Wind energy companies are seeking to extend a federal permit—from 5 to 30 years—allowing for a limited number of bald or golden eagle deaths. Bird lovers contend that the death of thousands of birds a year—including the nation’s symbol, still federally protected after years of population decline—is too steep a price to pay for power.   *—Diane Richard, writer, July 23*
