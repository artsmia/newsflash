**Targeted?**

****

Michael Brown, LaQuan McDonald, Freddie Gray, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, and now Jamar Clark. The death of Clark, a 24-year-old black man, at the hands of the Minneapolis Police Department sparked a chain of events: a two-week occupation of the city’s Fourth Precinct police station by hundreds of protesters, the shooting of four unarmed demonstrators, a thousand-person march, and the forced removal of protesters from their temporary camp. Clark’s case and other recent examples of law enforcement using lethal force on black males is at the heart of Mitchell Squire’s *Gladiators*. * *
