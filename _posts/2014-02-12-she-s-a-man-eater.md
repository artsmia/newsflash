**She’s a man-eater?**

****

A return of India’s Bengal tiger population has brought with it a predictable side effect: a spike in tiger attacks.

As the number of protected tigers rebounds from a low of 4,000 nationwide, so has the slate of human victims. Over a span of six weeks, 10 people in or near the state of Uttar Pradesh have succumbed to what might be a single female tiger. The attacks have pitted local people and conservationists against each other. Now, sharpshooters are tracking the big cats, while students rally with the slogan: “Save the tiger.”
