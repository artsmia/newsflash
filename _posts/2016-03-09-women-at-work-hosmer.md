**Women at work**

****

 Harriet Goodhue Hosmer was one of the leading female sculptors of the 19th century. Possibly the only woman of her time to gain complete financial independence through the success of her art, Hosmer was encouraged by her father to pursue art and physical activity, and even wore pants and a men’s shirt to paint. A rarity for females at the time, she got to study live models in Rome, helping her to master the anatomical proportions of the human body. Eventually, she even led her own studio in Rome, one comprised of all men. Hosmer’s Neoclassical interpretation of Medusa challenges the norms of how the Greek monster was typically portrayed, representing her in a beautiful human form.*
