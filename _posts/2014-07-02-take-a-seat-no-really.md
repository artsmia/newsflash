**Take a seat? No, really. **

****

An office job, once an aspiration for the working classes, is now practically a death sentence.

A review recently published in *The Journal of the National Cancer Institute* clinches it: Sitting can be fatal. A study of 70,000 cancer patients found that sitting is associated with a 24% increased risk of colon cancer, a 32% increased risk of endometrial cancer, and a 21% increased risk of lung cancer. It also leads to obesity and all its ills. Even worse? You can’t exercise away sitting’s harmful effects. On the bright side: Short bouts of movement might help. Think I’ll go walk this to the gallery right now.     *—Diane Richard, writer, July 2*
