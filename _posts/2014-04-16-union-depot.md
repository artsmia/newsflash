**All aboard!**

Demolition of New York City’s Pennsylvania Station, a Beaux Arts wonder designed by McKim, Mead & White (which also designed the MIA’s original building), began in October 1963. That same year, Twin Cities 400, a passenger express train between St. Paul and Chicago, ended service out of St. Paul’s Union Depot, which closed to the public in April 1971. 

Although 43 years have passed since the last train pulled out of Union Depot, Amtrak plans to resume service out of Lowertown’s newly renovated station on May 7. The Amtrak Empire Builder rolls into Gate C at 10 p.m., just in time to kick off the festivities for National Train Day on May 10.
