**Haggling over haggis land?**

****

The time for threats and bargaining has begun over the future of the United Kingdom. With Scotland’s independence referendum only days away, it’s anybody’s guess which side will prevail. 

A recent poll showed the “*Och Ayes*” gaining statistical strength. Meanwhile, English political leaders like Prime Minister David Cameron and Gordon Brown, former PM and a Scot to boot, are issuing dire warnings should the Ayes have it. Said Cameron: “So let no one in Scotland be in any doubt: we desperately want you to stay; we do not want this family of nations to be ripped apart.” —*Diane Richard, writer, September 10*
