**Water Power vs. Water View?**

****

A new hydroelectric plant proposed by Crown Hydro LLC for downtown Minneapolis could provide power for 4,000 homes. But the proposed site, upstream from St. Anthony Falls, is contentious for aesthetic reasons. Residents and Minneapolis Park Board commissioners are worried that the plant would divert too much water in the summer, a low point for the Mississippi River. 

This would jeopardize the picturesque heart of downtown Minneapolis, St. Anthony Falls, and the Stone Arch Bridge, exposing the former’s concrete spillway. Awaiting approvals from the Army Corps of Engineers and other agencies, the company plans for a 2014 start. *—Jennifer Komar Olivarez, associate curator, December 3*
