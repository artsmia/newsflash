**Are beer goggles real?**

****

The notion that inebriation makes the unattractive suddenly appealing was substantiated only by humiliating anecdotal evidence and some regrettable marriages in Vegas. 

Now there’s proof: British researchers tested volunteers who drank alcohol or a near-beer placebo. And not only did the drunks rate photos of men and women as more attractive then the sober folks did, they also found images of landscapes more attractive, suggesting the world in general is simply more beautiful through beer goggles. Good news for landscape artists, who may want to push the wine at openings.
