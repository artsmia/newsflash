**Up in smoke?**

****

Look closely: this painting paints a pretty pastoral picture of rural and industrial coexistence. Too bad we can’t live in Inness’s vision of a “civilized landscape.” 

Last week, President Obama used his executive authority to cut carbon emissions from the nation’s coal-fired power plants by up to 20 percent. The move will force industry to pay for the carbon pollution it creates. The new regulation, written by the EPA, will be the strongest action ever taken by an American president to tackle climate change.    *—Diane Richard, writer, June 4*
