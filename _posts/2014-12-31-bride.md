**Going it alone in Japan?**

****

This bride looks exhausted after her big day, awaiting her groom for the honeymoon. In Japan, she could enjoy a quiet wedding night all by herself. 

Today’s quirky trend from Japan is self-marriage. That’s right: women who marry themselves instead of waiting for Mr. (or Mrs.) Right. No compromising. No worries about getting jilted at the altar. And no in-laws. A travel agency invented the concept, and so far 30 “solo brides” have bit. Interestingly, half of those were already married, but didn’t have the wedding of their dreams.   —*Diane Richard, writer, December 31*
