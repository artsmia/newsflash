**If a Tree Falls…**

**Is It Rustic—or Ruinous?**

****

The big storm that hit Friday, June 21, left numerous big trees and branches strewn in its wake. A frequent subject of paintings like this one by Gainsborough, the uprooted tree of today symbolizes civic disarray and the impact of climate change rather than rustic reflection or the passage of time. Many homeowners noted that the roots of trees were severed during the recent replacement of city sidewalk squares, likely speeding their toppling—at tax payers’ expense.
