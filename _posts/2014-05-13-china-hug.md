**Pressing the flesh?**

This singer could use a hug, don’t you think? Until recently, the physical reserve of Chinese and Japanese was legendary. Travel guides for diplomats and tourists counseled against touching—or, worse, clutching.

No longer. As Asia ascends on the global scene, it’s taking on some Western interpersonal style points. In China, classrooms emphasizing “emotional intelligence” have dictated parental-hugging homework. There was even a report of “hugging activities” between Japanese and Chinese students.   *—Diane Richard, writer, May 13*
