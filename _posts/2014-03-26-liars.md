It’s not nice to call this master silversmith a liar. It’s also likely inaccurate, too—even though T.S.A. and others who rely on facial recognition methods might contend his shifty eyes declare otherwise. 

Looks now that looks deceive. Contrary to airport security screeners’ claims, recent studies report that tics, gestures, and guarded gazes don’t necessarily correlate to dishonesty. An analysis of 200 studies found that people correctly identified liars only 47% of the time, less than chance. In fact, ears are the best lie detectors: liars tend to be less forthcoming and tell less compelling stories. *—Diane Richard, writer, March 26*
