**Can’t buy me love?**

****

What’s the price of happiness? A recent survey rang up the cost of today’s American weddings compared to those of the 1930s. Looks like nuptial extravagance is a constant, even during the Depression.

Citing data from the wedding retail site the Knot, the average price tag of a contemporary wedding runs to nearly \$30,000, or roughly half of U.S. median household income. A 1930s wedding ran nearly \$400 (about \$6,500 in today’s dollars), about a quarter of median household income of the time. The good news? Today the groom’s suit is a steal, about a third of what it cost in 1930 before the days of mass production.
