**Sanskrit rock next big thing?**

****

Creative inspiration knows no geographic bounds, as these images of Westernized dandies of Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) show so magnificently. 

Recently, an Indian musician found inspiration in Eric Clapton’s classic rock song *Layla* for a work of his own—with a twist. Krish Ashok’s Indianized version, called *Leela*, contains all the familiar chords, but its lyrics are in Sanskrit. Posted on the audio-sharing site Soundcloud, *Leela* has been played almost 50,000 times. In writing *Layla*, Clapton himself drew inspiration from a 12th-century Persian love story.               —*Diane Richard, writer, April 1*
