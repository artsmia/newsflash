**Women at work**

****

 One of the most significant artists of the 20th century, Georgia O’Keeffe is known for her bold American Modernist paintings of flowers, bones, and desert landscapes. 

O’Keeffe also loved to explore the female body in her paintings. Even her nonrepresentational works, such as *Green-Gray Abstraction*, were seen as having a deep sexual meaning. In reality, she was simply one of the first artists who could explore her sexuality and representation as a female on the larger stage, and often had no sexual intentions behind her works. In her own words: “Well—I made you take time to look at what I saw and when you took time to really notice my flowers you hung all your own associations with flowers on my flower and you write about my flower as if I think and see what you think and see of the flower—and I don’t.”*—* *Ellie Hohulin, Learning Innovation intern, March 9*
