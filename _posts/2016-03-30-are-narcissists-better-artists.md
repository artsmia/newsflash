**Are narcissists better artists?**

****

Pablo Picasso once declared, “God is really an artist, like me…I am God.” He was, clinically speaking, a narcissist, turning every relationship toward himself and reveling in the glory he pushed for.

As an artist, he is hardly alone. A 2013 study found that narcissists are more likely than other people to consider themselves creative and to promote their creative work. Now a new study finds that the tendency works in their favor. Identifying narcissists by the size of their signature, how often they refer to themselves in interviews, and the number of self-portraits they make, the researcher found a correlation with success in the art market. The greater the narcissist, the greater the auction value of their work. The more you think of yourself, it seems, the more others do, too.
