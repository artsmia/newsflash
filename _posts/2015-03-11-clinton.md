**Casting a shadow?**

****

If we know anything from looking at this painting, *Mlle Lange as Danae*, it’s that artists often get the last word.

Nelson Shanks, whose painting of President Bill Clinton now hangs in the National Portrait Gallery, included all the trappings of presidential power: vases, andirons, a mantelpiece flanked by ionic columns. But the shadow over the fern, cast by a blue dress Shanks hung on a mannequin, alludes to presidential misbehavior. “Let's face it, that's a metaphor,” Shanks said. “"There's a major shadow across [Clinton’s] presidency.”—*Diane Richard, writer, March 11*
