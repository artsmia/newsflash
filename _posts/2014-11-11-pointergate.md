**Are you pointing at me?**

****

Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges, community activist Navell Gordon, and local organization Neighborhoods Organizing for Change have been the subject of controversy over some simple finger-pointing. 

Local news station KSTP, backed by several law enforcement agencies, claimed they were flashing a gang symbol. However, since time immemorial, we’ve used our index fingers to simply point. Hodges and Gordon, much like this scene in *Shepherd Boy Pointing at Tobias and the Angel*, were using their fingers for good—and emphasis.
