**‘Blade Runner’ hero
 no more? **

****

The murder trial of South African Paralympic athlete Oscar Pistorius has sparked international controversy. Pistorius, an Olympic athlete nicknamed the “blade runner” for his artificial limbs, has been charged with shooting and killing his girlfriend, model Reeva Steenkamp, on Valentine’s Day last year.  

Controversies surrounding the trial range from incriminating witness testimony to graphic forensic evidence taken from the crime scene. These only add to Pistorius’s tarnished reputation and invoke an image of an athletic and statuesque hero, fallen from grace.
