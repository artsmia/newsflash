Taxidermy, a pastime long dismissed as macabre at best, is now being revived in a British crafting class.

Students longing to skin, preserve, and pose critters are picking up tips from Margot Magpie, a pseudonym the instructor uses to evade animal-rights advocates on her trail. The aim is to mimic scenes in Beatrix Potter’s *Peter Rabbit* books, in which mice and voles wear hats and clothes to sip tea and enjoy picnics. The bats, owls, and lynx in this scene were similarly sculpted.     *—Diane Richard, writer, June 17*
