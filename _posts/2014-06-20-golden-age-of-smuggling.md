**Golden age of smuggling?**

****

India is learning what America learned during Prohibition: make something hard to get, and you’ll have all kinds of criminals working hard to get it. Gold, in this case, which India has raised import taxes on to help erase a budget deficit—leading to \$9 billion in illegally imported gold last year.

How do smugglers bring it in? That’s the interesting part: hidden under the toilet seat in an airplane restroom, melted into chips hidden in dates, turned into buckles or batteries or jewelry, and of course the inevitable stuffed-up-the-rectum trick.
