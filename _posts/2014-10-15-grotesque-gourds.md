**Grotesque gourds?**

****

In a way, artists are like Dr. Frankenstein, creating their unique vision out of so many assorted parts.

Tony Dighera, a California farmer, has taken his creations one step further: molded melons. He first experimented with growing a square watermelon, popular in Asia for its ability to stack. Now, he has perfected the “pumpkinstein,” a gourd grown in a plastic mold shaped with the face of the Frankenstein monster. These jocular jack-o-lanterns come with a collector’s price tag: about \$100 a piece.
