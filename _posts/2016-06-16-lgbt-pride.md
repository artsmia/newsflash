**LGBT Pride **

*The Girlfriends* directly connects to the nation’s LGBT rights movement in important ways. One of the figures in this duo, Jill Johnston, was an influential Lesbian activist and author of *Lesbian Nation: The Feminist Solution* (1973).

George Segal, the artist who captured this tender moment between Johnston and another woman, also created a monument near the Stonewall Inn in NYC, shown at right. On June 28, 1969, police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar. Its patrons fought back against what had become city-sanctioned harassment of gay people. This riot triggered a series of protests, including the first gay and lesbian march. The events at Stonewall are credited as the flashpoint for the LGBT rights movement we celebrate this month.
