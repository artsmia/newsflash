***Blood of Pope John Paul ll Stolen from Italian Chapel***

******

Thieves broke into a small church in the mountains of Abruzzo, Italy, this past weekend and stole a holy relic containing the blood of Pope John Paul II. The blood-soaked gauze is one of only three relics of the late Pope. 

The chapel and its picturesque surroundings were a favorite getaway for John Paul II, who visited the area frequently to escape the papal pressures of Rome. Area police are using sniffer dogs to trace the relic.
