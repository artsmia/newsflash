All over the country, people are dousing themselves with buckets of ice-cold water. Why? To raise money to fight ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, a neuro-degenerative condition. The Ice Bucket Challenge has spread like wildfire through social media outlets, in large part thanks to participation by celebrities (everyone from J Lo, to Lebron James, to *Vogue*’s notoriously stern editor Anna Wintour). As of this writing, it has raised over \$100 million for ALS research.

MIA staffers have taken the plunge, too. Though this ornate vessel was intended for ice *cream*, it would make a lovely ice bucket, don’t you think?
