**Hug a carp?**

****

Behold, lovely women cuddling carp. The fish is not only an invasive species, but also a girl’s best friend. *Karpermeisjes*, or Carp Girls, have befriended the whiskery bottom feeders while posing for a Facebook photo op. Imagine a modern mermaid, singing a “call of the carp,” as the fish swim lovingly to the surface for the day’s embrace, and a photoshoot to boot.

While this phenomenon may seem a bit strange, women and carp have been snuggling up since 1768. There really is nothing quite like the embrace of a 75-pound slippery aromatic fish. Have you hugged your carp today?
