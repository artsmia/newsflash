**Fashion’s rebel rebel?**

****

The seemingly sudden death of rock icon David Bowie has saddened fans worldwide of his avant-garde music, gender-defying glamour, and exuberant fashion tastes. 

With his gaunt physique and chiseled features, the protean Bowie has served as a fashion icon for some 50 years. Most recently, he was the subject of an art exhibition organized by the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, which later traveled to Chicago and other venues. 

Bowie’s elaborate costumes, like the one shown here in his Ziggy Stardust persona, seem to suit Cave’s *Soundsuit* to a T.*              —Diane Richard, writer, January 13*
