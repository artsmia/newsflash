**Women at work**

****

Recognized as the foremost animal painter of her time, Rosa Bonheur became one of the most established female painters in Europe and the U.S. Like *Palette*, most of her works focused on animals, and she frequented places like slaughterhouses to help her better understand the anatomy and emotions of her subjects. In her own words: “I became an animal painter because I loved to move among animals. I would study an animal and draw it in the position it took, and when it changed to another position I would draw that.” Trained as an artist from a young age, Bonheur was encouraged by her father to act liberally, and she began to dress as a man. Her defiant stance toward the typical roles of gender in society places her at the forefront of feminism.*
