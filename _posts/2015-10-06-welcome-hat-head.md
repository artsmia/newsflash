**Welcome, hat head?**

****

New arrivals to St. Paul won’t suffer the cold long, thanks to Jun-Li Wang, pictured below—whose hat resembles that of Mr. Baer’s slouchy fur cap.

 

At its inaugural Welcome Hat event this week, Wang’s group—St. Paul Hello—distributed faux-fur hats with flaps to newcomers. Wang, a transplant herself, sees it as a way to share Minnesota Nice while protecting non-natives against cold and ice.
