**Sacred and Profane?**

****

The Indian temple complex near the Bodhi Tree under which the Buddha is thought to have attained enlightenment was wracked by explosions this week. It was likely a terrorist attack, though no culprit has been named. The holy place is a UNESCO World Heritage site.

One imagines this youthful Buddha, by appearance classically Greco-Roman thanks to the intercultural trade winds that scattered Buddhism throughout Asia, would rue the distance he—and humankind—must continue to stride toward reaching salvation.
