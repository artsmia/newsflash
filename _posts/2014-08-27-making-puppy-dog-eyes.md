**Making puppy dog eyes?**

****

That dog owners resemble their pooches is well observed. Why is the question. A researcher from Japan took up the challenge, in a study showing headshot pairs of dogs and their owners to 500 undergrads.

Turns out the similarities have little to do with hairstyles, facial shape, gender, height or even eye color. After controlling for many factors, the study revealed that something—say, a certain warmth, ferocity, vulnerability—is being conveyed in the mutual look about the eyes of dogs and their people.
