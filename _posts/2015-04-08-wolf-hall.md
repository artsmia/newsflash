**Wolf at the Door?**

****

The fair young woman shown in this portrait might feel right at home in a series of TV and stage performances now freshening up the House of Tudor. 

Based on historical novels written by Hilary Mantel, the PBS miniseries *Wolf Hall* and Broadway productions of *Wolf Hall* and *Bring Up the Bodies* tell the story of King Henry VIII’s desire for a male heir—and the lengths he bids his brilliant henchman Thomas Cromwell to achieve it. Spoiler alert: Heads will roll. Luckily, this young woman managed to keep hers. Wearing royal jewels, a Tudor rose, and a motif associated with Catherine of Aragon, Henry VIII’s first wife, she has all the trappings of Tudor royalty.
