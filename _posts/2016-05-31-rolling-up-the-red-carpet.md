**Rolling up the red carpet?**

****

It’s a wonder that rugs like those scattered here were ever made. Over months, tiny fingers made so many colorful knots in intricate patterns—and that was *after* the work of shearing, spinning, and dyeing the wool. 

But the days of the so-called Persian carpet are fading fast. Made in Shiraz, Iran, and elsewhere, carpets have been underfoot of the elite for centuries. In the 15th century, Henry XIII’s court artist, Hans Holbein, painted them to dazzling effect. Today, though, mass-produced varieties are gaining ground, even for Iranians who can afford the real deal. Says one authority on carpets: “People simply are no longer interested in quality.” —*Diane Richard, writer, May 31, 2016 *
