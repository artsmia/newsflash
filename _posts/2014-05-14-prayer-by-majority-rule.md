**Prayer by majority rule?**

****

Official prayer at government meetings has lately been a touchy subject: who gets to say it, and to which god? But now the Supreme Court has made things simpler, ruling that local governments don’t need to be pluralistic in their prayers. If you only want Baptist preachers opening your town meetings, that’s your business—not the government’s. 

For nearly all of world history, of course, religion was very much the government’s business—and that of artists. Van Cleve, for instance, became well known for his religious portraits and was soon summoned to paint royal figures, as well. Church and state, inseparable, held the power and the patronage.
