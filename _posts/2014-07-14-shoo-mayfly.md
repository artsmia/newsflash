**Shoo fly, don’t bother me**

Batten down the hatches—the mayflies are coming! Millions of mayflies are hatching along the Mississippi River, and it’s quite a sight. Though the droves of insects attest to the mighty river’s health, the bugs are causing problems, including bug-slickened roads that led to a three-car pileup near Red Wing, Minn. 

The images below depicting swarms of mayflies in Minnesota and Wisconsin pair nicely with this Dutch still-life of rotting fruit, which, if you look closely, is covered with bugs! *—Katie Wildfong, Family & Teen Programs, July 23*
