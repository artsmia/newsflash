**BLT—Hold the bacon?**

****

Carnivores got the bad—though, truthfully, not wholly unexpected—news recently that consuming processed meats is linked to an increased risk of developing certain kinds of cancer. 

 

An international panel of experts convened by the World Health Organization concluded that eating processed meat—like hot dogs, ham and bacon—raises the risk of colon cancer and that consuming other red meats “probably” isn’t great for you either. But the increase in risk is so slight that experts said most people should not be overly worried about it. Still, for those of us who do eat meat, it’s one more reason to drop the Jucy Lucy.           *—Diane Richard, writer, October 28*
