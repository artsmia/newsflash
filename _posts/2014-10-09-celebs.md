**Celebrity exposé?**

****

For celebrities like Mlle. Lange and, more recently, Jennifer Lawrence, the difference between public and private is growing ever thinner.

Beautiful, talented, and willing to bare it all for their art, such actors have always captured the public’s eye. But in this month’s *Vanity Fair*, Lawrence asserted that the hijacking of cellphone photographs she took of herself in the buff were not for the consumption of admiring fans, but solely for her intended recipient. Indeed, she called the photos’ theft and subsequent release a “sex crime.”
