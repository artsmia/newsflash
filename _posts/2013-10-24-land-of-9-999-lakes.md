**Land of 9,999 Lakes?**

****

Despite Minnesota’s legendary lakes, recent droughts and population growth have overtaxed the state’s water resources. White Bear Lake alone has lost a quarter of its volume in 10 years. One idea to restore the lake involves redirecting water from the Mississippi River.  

Says the Friends of the Mississippi River, residents of White Bear Lake should first consider conservation before pursuing expensive refills. If the community—named for its ever-shallower lake—continues to guzzle its groundwater, refills will only be a temporary fix.
