**Frau fashionista?**

****

Bavaria’s traditional dirndl dress is seeing a revival as Germany’s fashionable set embrace the laced-up look.

The counterpart to men’s *lederhosen*, those leather knickers with bright suspenders, the dirndl dress has an apron, full skirt, and plunging neckline synched with laces. Today’s dirndl look is often topped with a rakishly plumed wool Bavarian hipster hat. One top maker of traditional Bavarian clothing said it sold about 16,000 dirndls last year, a 750 percent jump from 2002. Let’s see if Heidi Klum stalks the season’s runways in one.
