**Do these books make me look smart?**

****

If you want to look rich, you might pose in front of someone’s Lamborghini. With hundred-dollar bills cascading out of your pockets. If you want to look accomplished, you might do as Francisco de Mura did here, appearing among gold, marble, and fine drawings.

If you want to look smart, however, you’ll take a “bookshelfie,” a now-popular variant of the “selfie” cell-phone self-portrait in which you pose among shelves full of carefully curated books. And if you post it to Bookshelfies.tumblr.com you’ll likely even list your favorite books—not that you’ve necessarily read them.
