**Your cheating art?**

****

We’ve all been there. In the moment at which we must prove our mettle, we’re tempted to grab a crutch. This handkerchief, for example, is inked with the answers to some quiz from heck more than a century ago.

China hardly corners the market on cheats; however, 15 Chinese students were recently accused of hiring imposters to take entrance exams in hopes of securing seats at American universities. The accused allegedly paid nearly \$6,000 a pop for their ersatz edge. Suspicions about international students cheating on U.S. university entrance exams are nothing new. The charges include conspiracy, counterfeiting foreign passports, and wire and mail fraud.   —*Diane Richard, writer, June 3*
