**Egypt: Wrong address?**

****

This print by Titian depicts an episode from the *Book of Exodus*: Moses parting the Red Sea to lead the Israelites out of Egypt. 

Five hundred years later, Egypt recently sought to commemorate another dramatic water event: the multibillion-dollar expansion of the Suez Canal. To publicize the event, Egypt reproduced a rendering on a postage stamp. Problem was, the drawing was of the Panama Canal, located in South America, not the Suez Canal in Egypt. Oops. —*Diane Richard, writer, September 18*
