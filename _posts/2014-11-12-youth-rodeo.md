**Where reality wins out?**

****

The term “screentime” describes one more thing that’s ruining American childhoods, much like “junkfood” and “helicopter parenting.” But one place where reality beats the virtual any day is youth rodeo, a sport popular with riders equipped with ranges in their backyards.

Western states like Utah and Wyoming start ’em small; kids as young as 5 begin as mutton-busters, then age their way up to wrangle steers. Faced with a choice of playing video games or updating his Facebook status, one 6-year-old rider said, “I don’t want to sit on my lazy butt” as he adjusted his (required) Kevlar vest, helmet, and, of course, cowboy boots. —*Diane Richard, writer, November 11*
