**Driver Optional?**

****

Built for speed, handling, and comfort, the Tatra T87 was The Ultimate Driving Machine™ of its age. Since then, car design has been driven by luxury or efficiency, two irreconcilable goals until Tesla won the hearts of car lovers and conservationists alike. 

Does Google’s new car, just unveiled, indicate a completely new direction for car design? With no steering wheel, gas pedal, or even brakes, the Google Car is the first truly driverless car. You simply get in at point A and get out at point B. And with our seeming inability to refrain from texting or checking Facebook from behind the wheel, taking the burden of driving off the driver, er, passenger makes a lot of sense.
