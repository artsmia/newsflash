**Hidden treasure?**

Fans of mid-century modernism recently got a gift from on high. High above a drop-paneled ceiling, that is. In St. Louis, home of Eero Saarinen’s Gateway Arch, an exhibition focused on “mid-mod” drew attention to works from the era of space exploration. Drawings and maquettes highlighted works in the region that once were.

Soon after, a “lunar landscape” emerged, designed in the mid-1940s by Isamu Noguchi for the American Stove Company-Magic Chef Co. After seeing the modernism show, the president of the U-Haul Company, which now owns the building, took down the paneling to reveal Noguchi’s space-age biomorphic ceiling.       *—Diane Richard, writer, May 12, 2016 *
