**Maya Angelou, Remembered**

****

Maya Angelou—poet, novelist, actor, and activist—died on May 28, 2014, at the age of 86. Angelou was a revered literary voice committed to civil rights. Her most famous work, “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,” was a brutal and brilliant account of Angelou’s coming-of-age in the Jim Crow South. Angelou once said, “History, despite its wrenching pain, cannot be unlived, but if faced with courage, need not be lived again.”
