The first-ever experiment featuring human brain-to-brain communication was a complete, if not eerie, success. Using a wearable brain device made of magnets and electrodes, University of Washington professor Rajesh Rao sent a neural signal across campus to colleague Andrea Stucco. With this electronic input, Stucco twitched a finger, hitting a space bar and completing an action in a video game Rao was playing.
