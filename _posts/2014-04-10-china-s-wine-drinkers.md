**For all the wine in China?**

****

China is swooshing and sipping more claret than just about any other country bar one: the U.S. of A.

Purchases of bottles worth \$10 and more have soared in China (and Hong Kong, whose wine consumption was factored in with the mainland). And China leads the world in consumption of more affordable red wine, aka rotgut. China, of course, is no stranger to fermented grapes—as this 11th-century wine vessel attests. No doubt, China will soon lead the world in red-wine hangovers as well. *—Diane Richard, writer, April 10*
