**Who Needs College?**

****

Everyone, says Michelle Obama in a recent speech to Washington, D.C., high school students. It was the first stop in the First Lady’s cross-country speaking tour aimed at inspiring more young people to pursue post-secondary education.

Her critics dispute the value (and expense) of a college degree at a time when increasingly credits are amassed through MOOCs (massive open online courses) and at for-profit universities. Liberal arts education and elite colleges are also under scrutiny, seen as refuges from the real world for the privileged few—not unlike the *Studio of Gratifying Discourse*.
