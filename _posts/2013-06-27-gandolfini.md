**An Idyllic Landscape for Tony Soprano?**

****

Actor James Gandolfini died at age 51 of a heart attack on June 19. Like most people, when I think of Gandolfini, I think of Tony Soprano and his New Jersey mob. We were all hooked on *The Sopranos* due to the development of complex characters—and their relationship to place. And not just any place; New Jersey, where most of the show was filmed.

Gandolfini grew up close to Montclair and with his character’s multiple industrial business“interests,” he probably would have understood Inness’s inclusion of a factory in a beautiful landscape.
