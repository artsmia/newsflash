**ZIP Code Joins AARP?
**

****

The 1791 Parisians depicted in this painting might have spilled tea from their elegant cups hearing the events of 1963 United States Postal Service—the introduction of the ZIP (Zone Improvement Plan) Code. 

Americans weren’t too pleased, either, with the plan to increase efficiency of mail delivery. On the heels of expanding the telephone area code, we citizens were worried about becoming just a number. But with Mr. Zip’s help, there was 86% usage within 6 years.
