**Rock ’n’ Read?**

****

A Minnetonka couple has developed a fun way to try to close the educational achievement gap in Minneapolis. 

After converting an old bus into a portable singing and reading lab, they’ve found that kids can advance one year in reading with only 11 hours of singing! The bus is equipped with 32 computers, allowing the couple to bring reading and learning right into the students’ neighborhood. Now that’s something to truly sing about!     *—Roma Rowland, Administrative Assistant*
