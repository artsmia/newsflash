**Whackdoodle Names: Blessing or Curse?**

****

Nameoftheyear.com has recognized Shamus Beaglehole as having the . . . you guessed it, 2014 Name of the Year. Runners up included Eve Gruntfest, Loki Skylizard, and Genghis Cohen. Had mental floss sites like this one existed 200 years ago, we suspect our very own Orlando Hand Bears might have been a contender.

Do funky names help or harm? A 2013 Freakonomics study indicates the jury’s still out. Mr. Beaglehole, a pro soccer player for the Chesterfield Football Club, is doing just fine, thank you very much.
