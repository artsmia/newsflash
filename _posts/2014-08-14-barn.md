**Paint the party barn red?**

****

Barns hold more than living animals, carcasses, and piles of hay. For many urbanites these days, they are romantic backdrops for rustic nuptial celebrations.

Farmers looking to make a little extra cash see the latest trend as a godsend, and some have made steep investments on improving sound systems and dance floors. Neighbors who aren’t in on the action, however, complain these rural revelries spoil the pastoral peace: lots of traffic, loud music, and drunken wedding woops till the cows come home.   —*Diane Richard, writer, August 13*
