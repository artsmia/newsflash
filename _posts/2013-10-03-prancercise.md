The graceful movements of horses have inspired humans for millennia. People like Joanna Rohrback, founder of Prancercise. Though around since 1989, her new dance form has recently taken YouTube and the late-night talk shows by storm.

This—um—unconventional exercise program is a “springy, rhythmic way of moving forward, similar to a horse’s gait and ideally induced by elation,” Rohrback says. Feel free to sample it, inspired by these prancing stallions. You might just give the guards a chuckle.   *—* *Amanda Thompson Rundahl, museum educator, October 2*
