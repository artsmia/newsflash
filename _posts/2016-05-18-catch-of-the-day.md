**Catch of the day?**

****

Two amateur divers recently discovered Israel’s biggest haul of underwater Roman-era artifacts in a generation, including, at left, figurines of Luna (later identified with the goddess Diana; note the moon tiara) and Dionysus.

The divers discovered the treasures while exploring a sunken ship near an ancient port. As soon as they realized their catch, they alerted the country’s antiquities authority. The trove of priceless  artifacts included bronze statues, lamps, jars, animal-shaped objects, anchors, and thousands of coins featuring images of the Roman emperors Constantine and Licinius. The oldest objects date to the first century CE. —*Diane Richard, writer, May 18, 2016 *
