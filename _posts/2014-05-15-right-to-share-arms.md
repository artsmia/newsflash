**Right to share arms?**

****

The College of Arms, the U.K. organization that governs royal coats of arms, has welcomed very rich titled gay people—hello, Sir Elton John!—to apply. 

If approved, Sir Elton, who is believed to be marrying his civil partner David Furnish in a private ceremony this month, will be able to conjoin this custom shield (shown below: note keyboard) with his betrothed’s. Or, as the College puts it, same-sex spouses may now “impale” the arms of their husband or wife with their own on a heraldic shield or banner. Ouch! *—Diane Richard, writer, May 15*
