**Hug a great white?**

****

For anyone over the age of, say, 45, this beat—

bah dum, bah dum, Bah Dum, Bah Dum, *BAH DUM*—sends chills.

Younger generations who didn’t cringe during the movie *Jaws* see sharks today less as a fearsome maneater, and more as a dolphin-like character with goofy grin. Case in point: When sharks emerged on Cape Cod a few years ago, sidling up to a smorgasbord of seal, the town’s cop, science geek, and macho seafarer didn’t gather to hunt the Big One. Rather, the mantra became “spread the white shark love!” *—Diane Richard, writer, August 4*
