**Will Sandmining Change?**

****

Used in domestic drilling for oil and gas, the Midwest’s bounty of sand is being mined and sent by rail to North Dakota and elsewhere. The sudden economic boon, though, may carry a price. 

Contrast this picture’s view with “Mount Frac” in downtown Winona. Do we fully know the risks of such mining? Do we have the political will to change to a more sustainable energy source? What will my view be when I kayak on the St. Croix? What will my view be when I kayak on the St. Croix? What will my view be.
