**How into art are you?**

****

This week, an American foreign exchange student in Germany served as a reminder to art enthusiasts everywhere. While attempting to get a “funny” tourist photo, he fell into a large, 13-ton sculpture of a vulva;
 it took 22 firefighters to remove him. 

Touching, or, worse, getting stuck in a work of art not only can be dangerous and cause physical harm, but it can also be mortifying and make international news. Think twice before sticking your hands (or your entire body) into the art!
