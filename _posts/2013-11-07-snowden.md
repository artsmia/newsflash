**Will Snowden disappear, too?**

****

G men in Washington, D.C., investigated Barton Kestle’s supposed “unAmerican” activities, and he was never heard from again. Or so goes artist Mark Dion’s tale. 

What do you think will happen if they get their hands on government documents leaker/hero/traitor Edward Snowden, now cooling off in Russia? One thing’s for sure: U.S. citizens will never wonder whether our government is watching us again.
