**Your Cheating Art?**

****

The Harvard student cheating scandal. The Atlanta schools score-changing scandal. Pirated movies, overblown mileage reports, rounded-up receipts. Not to mention Madoff, Petters, and Hecker. 

Cheating seems widespread these days. Now, research points to why: we get a neurological lift when we get away with something. A study published recently in *The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology* showed that many of us actually feel happy after cheating, as long as we believe we’re not hurting anyone. The IRS isn’t people, right?             *—Diane Richard, writer, October 9*
