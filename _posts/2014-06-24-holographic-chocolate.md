**Eye candy of the future?**

****

The future is here! A Swiss company has found a way to imprint holograms onto chocolates. This isn’t your 1980’s aluminum-printed holograph of the Starship Enterprise, but the chocolate itself actually has grooves and bumps that refract light around its fat crystals. 

Many of us know the profound pleasure of the taste and mouth feel of chocolate. Now, our eyes will get a visual feast, too. Look for the hologram chocolates next year, when worldwide distribution is set to begin.
