**A heritage lost in Syria?**

****

Since Syria’s civil war began, an estimated 33 churches, hundreds of mosques, and now the country’s oldest synagogue have been destroyed. The Eliyahu Hanabi Synagogue, built to honor the prophet Elijah, was at least 400 years old and contained thousands of cultural treasures, from Torah scrolls hundreds of years old to dining ware to Judaica of all sorts. 

Though some of the artifacts had reportedly been looted already or removed for safekeeping, all that was left in the building was presumably obliterated in a government bombardment of Damascus over the weekend of May 23.
