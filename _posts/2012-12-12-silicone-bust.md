**Bust Justice?**

****

Women’s quest for the ideal bustline has led to many innovations, Wonder Bras among them. Introduced in the 90s, the silicone breast implant is one of the more popular and visible augmentations on the market.

After years of lawsuits, one maker of silicone implants, PIP, was sentenced in December for dealing in defective décolletage goods. The company’s sale of faulty implants, prone to rupture and leakage because of its use of industrial-grade silicone, sparked a global health crisis that harmed an estimated 300,000 women in 65 countries. *—Diane Richard, writer, December 11*
