**Walking Away from Cancer?**

****

A new study of middle-aged women reveals that physical activity can substantially reduce the risk of breast cancer. Researchers combed through the medical data of some 73,600 women ages 50–73 collected over 20 years. The results? Women who walked at least seven hours a week had a 14% lower risk of developing breast cancer than those who walked fewer than three hours a week. Workouts of greater intensity yielded even greater benefits. 

Scientists don’t fully understand the biology behind these results, but we predict a 17% increase in home-workout DVDs. Zumba, anyone?
