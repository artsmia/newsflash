**Spare some change?**

****

Recently, President Obama and Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew announced that Harriet Tubman will be the new face of the U.S. \$20 bill. Tubman, a former enslaved person and abolitionist, will become the first woman on paper money since Martha Washington briefly appeared on the \$1 silver certificate in the 19th century. In the process, she will oust Andrew Jackson.

In *Reminiscences of 1865,*Abraham Lincoln, the face on the \$5 bill and the President who fought for the freedom of slaves during the Civil War, is paid tribute. Along with his portrait, there is a 25-cent shinplaster and a coin, showing some of the currency used in the time of Tubman and Lincoln. It seems only fitting now that these two national heroes will sit side by side in Americans’ wallets. Tubman’s \$20 will be released by 2020.
