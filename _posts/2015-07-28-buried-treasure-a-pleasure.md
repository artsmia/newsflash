**Buried treasure a pleasure?**

****

‘What pet should I get?’ is a rollicking rhyme posed in the title of a “new” book by writer Theodor Seuss Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss. Recently published, the illustrated book was found in a box in 2013, along with numerous orphaned sketches. With his whimsical classics like *The Cat in the Hat* and *Green Eggs and Ham*, Dr. Seuss has been enchanting young readers for half a century. It was assumed we had heard the last from him—but no! 

Yoshitomo Nara’s sculpture *Your Dog* reminds us how big the world can seem through a child’s eyes. *What Pet Should I Get?* is about making choices: fish or fowl, dog or cat. Which pet would you choose?
