**A mountain on the roof?**

****

Zhang Biqing spent six years building a craggy aerie resembling the idealized mountains of classical Chinese art, complete with fake boulders and winding walkways—atop his 26th-story Beijing apartment. Instead of a poets’ salon, there’s a karaoke lounge. 

And now it’s coming down. Seems the wealthy owner of a chain of traditional Chinese medicine clinics never had the blessing of the city, much less his neighbors, whom he reportedly threatened when they complained. Some idealizations, it seems, were never meant to be—at least not on the roof.
