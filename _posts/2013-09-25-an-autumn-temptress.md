**An Autumn Temptress?**

****

Despite a cool spring that delayed the growing season, the apple harvest in Minnesota is going to be much better than last year’s spotty performance. Growers are expected to haul in 20 million pounds of the tempting fruit. Small potatoes, er, apples, compared to Washington’s 100 million pounds. But Minnesota’s apples go for higher prices, owing to better quality. Go ahead—take the fruit from Eve’s hand!
