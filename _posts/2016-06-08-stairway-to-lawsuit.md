**Stairway to lawsuit?**

****

What do *The Doryphoros* and Led Zeppelin have in common? Both classics took inspiration from other artists—at least, so a lawsuit filed against the U.K. rock band claims. 

*The Doryphoros* is a Roman copy of an earlier Greek work. No problem there. But the “descending chromatic four-chord progression” that starts the song “Stairway to Heaven” may have been lifted from another song, “Taurus,” written by Randy Wolfe for the band Spirit. A trustee for Wolfe’s estate is now suing the band members of Led Zeppelin for copyright infringement. Previous plagiarism charges against the band have resulted in a revision of credits on its albums to include the names of the accusing songwriters.   —*Diane Richard, writer, June 8, 2016*
